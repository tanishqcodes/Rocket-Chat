i) _Connect_ to the port (server as well as clients)

ii) The clients which are connected to the same server can communicate.

iii) There can be multiple instances of clients connected to the same server for communication. 

**HOW TO RUN? **
> The json file has two servers at present, one of them is discord. So when you will run the server.py file, it will ask you to choose the server form the avalaible list of servers. Choose one, Voila! Your server is up and running.

> Say your _"discord"_ server is up and running. Now we can connect clients to this server. So run the client.py file. Enter the relevant details and that is it, you're connected to the server.
